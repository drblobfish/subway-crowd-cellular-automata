# subway-crowd-cellular-automata

The location of agents in a subway wagon are subject to complex dynamics : people want a comfortable place while avoiding proximity to other people. Added to the constant flow of subway users entering and exiting the wagon, these dynamics results in more or less efficient flow of people.

We want to model the flow and distribution of agents evolving in a subway wagon to study the impact of the geometry of subway (position of seats and metal pole) on the flow and the final distribution of agents as well as the number of users that were able to find a comfortable place.

We propose a cellular automata model describing the interaction between agents, walls of the metro, seats, and rest position (ie. next to the walls and to the metal poles).

## Demo

Python notebook `model_testing.ipynb` contains somewhat clean demos of our model.

## Our model

See our poster and final report in `documentation` for explaination on our model.

## Context

This code is produced as an assignment during the Modelisation Project Week in the [Frontiers of Life Bachelor](https://licence.learningplanetinstitute.org/fr) (Center for Interdisciplinary Research, University of Paris).
